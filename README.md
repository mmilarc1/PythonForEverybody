# PythonForEverybody

### Goals

-   Complete the Python for Everybody Specialization

### Boundaries / Scope

-   Complete Course 1 Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)
-   Complete Course 2 Python Data Structures

### Success criteria

-   My own application for data retrieval and processing.
-   Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.

### Constraints

-   I will be auditing the course for free so will be able to read and view the course content but not submit projects or earn the certification.

### Assumptions

-   The courses will be available for the duration of the semester.
-   I have all required software.
-   I can skip the Installing and Using Python units.

### Stakeholders

-   Professor - for grade
-   Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud
-   Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job

### Timeline

Week:

1.  Chapter One - Why we Program? (3 hours)
2.  Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions (3 hours)
3.  Chapter Three: Conditional Code (3 hours)
4.  Chapter Five: Loops and Iteration (3 hours)
5.  Chapter Four: Functions (2 hours)

Ch 6 notes  
•	We read and convert  
•	Things such as input numbers must be converted to a string  
•	Colon operator lets us use any section of string  
•	Concatenation “+” combines strings  
•	Use in as logical operator  
•	Python strings stored in string library 
•	“find” function finds strings within other strings  
•	Strip whitespace away with lstrip() rstrip() 
 
Ch 7 notes  
  
  
 
	Input and output devices -à software: . secondary memory 
•	CPU 
•	Main memory                                            
	Open function tells which file  
	File handle is a variable used to perform operations  
	We use a newline character /n  to indicate when a line ends  
	We can use if statement inside a for loop to retrieve lines of code that meet certain criteria  
	Continue statement skips a line of code 
	What we name files is important  
	Chapter 8 notes  
	Collection allows us to make many values in a single variable  
	List element can be any python object- even another list  
	List coincide well with definite loops  
	Using index we can change the content of a list, unlike a string which is mutable.  
	Range returns list of numbers that’s one less than the parameter  
	List can be sliced like strings  
	Build a list using append
